# quandl-python-demo
A notebook to be used as a python demo in the Data Mindset.

This repo populates the Binder at https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/DecodedCo/quandl-python-demo/master


Intended use is running the code, then running `data.tail()` and then `data.plot()` in the two empty cells provided.

## Prep before delivery:
  1. Run everything in the notebook to make sure it works
  2. Restart kernel and clear all output
  3. Run the first cell and then delete it
  4. If running through Binder, and not locally, then make sure the Binder kernel is running and active 2 minutes before the demo.
