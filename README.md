# quandl-python-demo
A notebook to be used as a python demo in the Data Mindset.

This repo populates the Binder here: [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/DecodedCo/quandl-python-demo/master)

Note that there are two versions of this demo. 

## v1.2
Intended use is running the code, then running `data.tail()` and then `data.plot()` in the two empty cells provided.

## v1.3
Intended use is running the code once through to see the outputs, then run it again for a different Zillow data
key on Quandl and critiquing the lack of annotation around the methodology used for the FB Prophet model.

## Prep before delivery:
  1. Run everything in the notebook to make sure it works
  2. Restart kernel and clear all output
  3. Run the first cell and then delete it
  4. If running through Binder, and not locally, then make sure the Binder kernel is running and active 2 minutes 
  before the demo.
